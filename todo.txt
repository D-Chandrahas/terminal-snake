getters and setters
better arg names
sync header file
use enum for heading
check values in setheading(should be one of ['u','d','l','r'])
formatting of getters and setters
setters should return bool or ptr
destructors(esp. snake)

change code (append functions) to handle nodes made of 2 chars
main loop
    get input (handle no input with nodelay())
    move snake in memory based on input(update x,y,heading etc)
    check if snake should die
    check if snake ate food
        increase snake length
        new food
    update screen
